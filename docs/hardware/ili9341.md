## ILI Technologie Corp. (Ilitek)

a-Si TFT LCD Single Chip Driver 240RGBx320 Resolution and 262K color.

## Introduction (from datasheet)

ILI9341 is a 262,144-color single-chip SOC driver for a-TFT liquid crystal display with resolution of
240RGBx320 dots, comprising a 720-channel source driver, a 320-channel gate driver, 172,800 bytes GRAM for 
graphic display data of 240RGBx320 dots, and power supply circuit.

ILI9341 supports parallel 8-/9-/16-/18-bit data bus MCU interface, 6-/16-/18-bit data bus RGB interface and 
3-/4-line serial peripheral interface (SPI). The moving picture area can be specified in internal GRAM by window 
address function. The specified window area can be updated selectively, so that moving picture can be 
displayed simultaneously independent of still picture area.

ILI9341 can operate with 1.65V ~ 3.3V I/O interface voltage and an incorporated voltage follower circuit to 
generate voltage levels for driving an LCD. ILI9341V supports full color, 8-color display mode and sleep mode 
for precise power control by software and these features make the ILI9341 an ideal LCD driver for medium or 
small size portable products such as digital cellular phones, smart phone, MP3 and PMP where long battery life 
is a major concern.
