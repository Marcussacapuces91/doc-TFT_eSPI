title: Welcome to TFT_eSPI's documentation!
---

[TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) is a C library that, as indicated on its GitHub page, is a library 
compatible with Arduino and PlatformIO IDEs, optimized for Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), STM32, ESP8266, and ESP32, which
supports different screen drivers.

I'm starting a detailed documentation of this library, which I found lacking for my ESP32 developments.

I hope this documentation helps you in developing with the TFT_eSPI library. Please don't hesitate to provide feedback
on what works and what doesn't, so we can improve this documentation together.
