[TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) is a C library that, as indicated on its GitHub page, is a library 
compatible with Arduino and PlatformIO IDEs, optimized for Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), STM32, ESP8266, and ESP32, which
supports different screen drivers.

I'm starting a detailed documentation of this library, which I found lacking for my ESP32 developments.

I hope this documentation helps you in developing with the TFT_eSPI library. Please don't hesitate to provide feedback
on what works and what doesn't, so we can improve this documentation together.

!!! Warning

    This project is under active development. Your help is desperately needed!
